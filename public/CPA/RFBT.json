It is intended to protect both the proprietary and voting rights of a stockholder in a corporation, since such proportionate interest determines his proportionate power to vote in corporate affairs when the law gives the shareholders a right to affirm or deny board actions. It is a common law right which may be exercised by stockholders even when no provision is stated in the law Statement 2: Right of first refusal provides that a stockholder who may wish to sell or assign his shares must first offer the shares to the corporation or to other existing stockholders of the corporation, under terms and conditions which are reasonable and that only when the corporation or the other stockholders do not or fail to exercise their option, is the offering stockholder at liberty to dispose of his shares to third parties. It arises only by virtue of contractual stipulations in which case the right is construed strictly against the right of persons to dispose of or deal with their property. It is normally available in a close corporation as stated in its articles of incorporation as a type of transfer restriction",
